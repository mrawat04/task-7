# README: SQLite Sales Analysis Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic workflow to manage and analyze sales data using SQLite3 and Python.

## What Was Done

1. **Created SQLite Database**

   * Database file: `sales_data.db`
   * Created a `sales` table to store product, quantity, and price information.

2. **Inserted Sample Data**

   * Added multiple sample rows representing sales of different products.

3. **Connected to Database Using Python**

   * Used `sqlite3` to connect to the database from Jupyter Notebook.

4. **Queried Data and Summarized Sales**

   * Pulled sales summaries and aggregated information (e.g., total quantity, revenue).

5. **Visualized Data**

   * Used `matplotlib` to plot a bar chart showing revenue per product.

## Notes

* The `.db` file is portable and can be used in any Python environment.
* Jupyter Notebook was used for Python execution, data handling with Pandas, and visualization with Matplotlib.
